        <p>
        I'm an infosec analyst of over 10 years with experience of working in both the blue and red side of cyber security. I am currently a Lead Analyst in the SOC of a large multinational company.

        As well as my day job, I also like to take part in lots of CTFs and also bug bounty. This blog is where I hope to document some of my bug bounty findings, CTF walkthroughs and generally anything else I find interesting.

	  Remember, infosec isn't so much as a job of a passion and no-one can or will ever know everything - never stop learning!
