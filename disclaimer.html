					A lot of what you'll find in the write-ups and walkthroughs on this site talks about hacking techniques. All of these were carried out against known endpoints or challenges where permission to hack had been explicitly granted by the owner. All of the content on this blog is presented in the same spirit. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Before attempting any hacking, you should make yourself familiar with the applicable laws in your country, eg, The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Misuse_Act_1990">Computer Misuse act</a> in the UK or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act">CFAA</a> in the US. Never attempt to hack a system for which you do not have written permission to do so.

					Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.
